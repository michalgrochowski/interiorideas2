# interiorideas2

Second version of an portfolio site made for my friends mom, who is a interior designer. You can check the original design in another repo - "interiorideas1".

Layout made entirely with Flexbox, form validation made using RegExp with jQuery without any external library. Some of the hover effects are supposed to look like "material design" by Google.

Made with:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Scss with BEM)
- jQuery
- Lightbox 2
